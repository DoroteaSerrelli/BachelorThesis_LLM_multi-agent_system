# BachelorThesis_LLM_multi-agent_system

## Overview

Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated extraordinary capabilities in language generation, comprehension, and few-shot learning in recent years. 
Furthermore, it has been shown that by applying an approach inspired by the 'society of minds,' where multiple instances of language models propose and debate their individual responses and reasoning processes across multiple rounds to arrive at a common final answer, mathematical reasoning and the factual validity of generated content are significantly improved, reducing incorrect answers and hallucinations that contemporary models are prone to.

The focus of my thesis is on the study and definition of the architecture of a multi-agent LLM system, in which one or more autonomous agents collaborate to perform tasks related to generating source code from natural language descriptions provided by the user. Subsequently, the performance achieved by the multi-agent LLM system in solving the aforementioned task will be analyzed and compared to that of a single LLM specialized in source code generation.
