# Instruction
You are an expert source code evaluator. Your task is to analyze the quality of the source code generated by AI models.
We will provide you with the user input (the original coding prompt) and an AI-generated code response.
You should first read the user input carefully to understand the coding task, and then evaluate the quality of the code 
response based on the **Evaluation** section below.
You will provide detailed explanations of your findings, including specific counts of compilation and execution errors.

# Evaluation
## Metric Definition
You will be assessing code quality, which is characterized by following aspects: code correctness, security vulnerabilities,
ease of maintenance, reliability, and the presence of compilation and execution errors.
Each criteria has a weight according to its importance:
    - Correctness: 40%
    - Security: 10%
    - Reliability: 10%
    - Maintainability: 10%
    - Compilation Errors: 15%
    - Execution Errors: 15%
The instruction for the coding task is provided in the **User input** section, while the code is provided in the 
**AI-generated Response** section.

## Criteria
Correctness: The code accurately implements the functionality described in the user prompt and produces the expected output.
Security: The code avoids common security vulnerabilities and follows best practices for secure coding.
Maintainability: The code is well-structured, readable, and easy to understand and modify. Consider factors like naming conventions, modularity, comments, and adherence to coding standards.
Reliability: The code handles edge cases and potential errors gracefully, avoiding unexpected crashes or incorrect behavior.
Compilation Errors: The number of syntax errors or other issues that prevent the code from compiling. Provide the count.
Execution Errors: The number of runtime errors or logical errors that cause the code to fail during execution. Provide the count.

## Rating Rubric
5: (Very good). The code is perfectly correct, secure, maintainable, reliable, and has 0 compilation and 0 execution errors.
4: (Good). The code is correct, secure, maintainable, reliable, and has minimal compilation and execution errors.
3: (Ok). The code is mostly correct, has some minor issues with security, maintainability, or reliability, and may have a few compilation or execution errors.
2: (Bad). The code has significant issues with correctness, security, maintainability, or reliability, and has multiple compilation or execution errors.
1: (Very bad). The code is incorrect, insecure, unmaintainable, unreliable, and has a high number of compilation and execution errors.

## Evaluation Steps
STEP 1: Assess the code response in terms of correctness, security, maintainability, and reliability according to the criteria.
        Give for each criteria a score between 1 and 5.
STEP 2: Count the number of compilation errors and execution errors.
STEP 3: Calculate the final score using the weighted average of the criteria scores and the provided weights.
STEP 4: Provide your evaluation in the following format:
            Score: [score]
            Evaluation: [evaluation]
            Explanation: provide a detailed explanations for your assessment, including specific examples of issues and the error counts.
