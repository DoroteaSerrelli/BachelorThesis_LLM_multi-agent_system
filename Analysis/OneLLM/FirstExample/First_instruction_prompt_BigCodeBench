Evaluation
EVALUATION PROMPT
# Instruction
You are an expert source code evaluator. Your task is to analyze the quality of the source code generated by AI models.
We will provide you with the user input (the original coding prompt) and an AI-generated code response.
You should first read the user input carefully to understand the coding task, and then evaluate the quality of the code 
response based on the **Evaluation** section below.
You will provide detailed explanations of your findings, including specific counts of compilation and execution errors.

# Evaluation
## Metric Definition
You will be assessing code quality, which is characterized by following aspects: code correctness, security vulnerabilities,
ease of maintenance, reliability, and the presence of compilation and execution errors.
For each criteria, described in Criteria section, you will generate a score between 0 and 100.
The instruction for the coding task is provided in the **User input** section, while the code is provided in the 
**AI-generated Response** section.


## Criteria
Correctness: The code accurately implements the functionality described in the user prompt and produces the expected output.
Security: The code avoids common security vulnerabilities and follows best practices for secure coding.
Maintainability: The code is well-structured, readable, and easy to understand and modify. Consider factors like naming conventions, modularity, comments, and adherence to coding standards.
Reliability: The code handles edge cases and potential errors gracefully, avoiding unexpected crashes or incorrect behavior.
Compilation Errors: The number of syntax errors or other issues that prevent the code from compiling. Provide the count.
Execution Errors: The number of runtime errors or logical errors that cause the code to fail during execution. Provide the count.

# Output Format

This results in incorrect calculations and potential errors since it does not consider the shuffled list. \n3. **Default List Size**: The default list size is set to range(1, 3), which provides only two numbers (1, 2).

Evaluation
EVALUATION PROMPT
# Instruction
You are an expert source code evaluator. Your task is to analyze the quality of the source code generated by AI models.
We will provide you with the user input (the original coding prompt) and an AI-generated code response.
You should first read the user input carefully to understand the coding task, and then evaluate the quality of the code 
response based on the **Evaluation** section below.
You will provide detailed explanations of your findings, including specific counts of compilation and execution errors.

# Evaluation
## Metric Definition
You will be assessing code quality, which is characterized by following aspects: code correctness, security vulnerabilities,
ease of maintenance, reliability, and the presence of compilation and execution errors.
For each criteria, described in Criteria section, you will generate a score between 0 and 100.
The instruction for the coding task is provided in the **User input** section, while the code is provided in the 
**AI-generated Response** section.


## Criteria
Correctness: The code accurately implements the functionality described in the user prompt and produces the expected output.
Security: The code avoids common security vulnerabilities and follows best practices for secure coding.
Maintainability: The code is well-structured, readable, and easy to understand and modify. Consider factors like naming conventions, modularity, comments, and adherence to coding standards.
Reliability: The code handles edge cases and potential errors gracefully, avoiding unexpected crashes or incorrect behavior.
Compilation Errors: The number of syntax errors or other issues that prevent the code from compiling. Provide the count.
Execution Errors: The number of runtime errors or logical errors that cause the code to fail during execution. Provide the count.

# Output Format
You must return your evaluation strictly in the following JSON format:

    The line len(number) should be len(numbers). Since number is an integer, calling len() on it causes a TypeError at runtime.
    The logic is almost correct, but this bug prevents the function from returning the correct result."
}
```

## Evaluation Steps
STEP 1: Assess the code response in terms of correctness, security, maintainability, and reliability according to the criteria.
        Give for each criteria a score between 0 and 100.
STEP 2: Count the number of compilation errors and execution errors.
STEP 3: Provide your evaluation in the JSON format described in Output Format section.


# User Input
Calculates the average of the sums of absolute differences between each pair of consecutive numbers for all permutations of a given list. Each permutation is shuffled before calculating the differences. Args: - numbers (list): A list of numbers. Default is numbers from 1 to 10.
The function should output with:
    float: The average of the sums of absolute differences for each shuffled permutation of the list.
You should write self-contained code starting with:
```
import itertools
from random import shuffle
def task_func(numbers=list(range(1, 3))):
```

## AI-generated Response

from random import shuffle

import itertools

    total_sum = 0
    permutations = list(itertools.permutations(numbers))
    for perm in permutations:
        shuffled_perm = list(perm)
        shuffle(shuffled_perm)
        sum_diffs = 0
        for i in range(len(shuffled_perm) - 1):
            sum_diffs += abs(shuffled_perm[i] - shuffled_perm[i + 1])
        total_sum += sum_diffs
    avg = total_sum / len(permutations)
    return avg



{
  "Compilation Errors": 0,
  "Correctness": 75,
  "Execution Errors": 1,
  "Explanation": "The AI-generated code is mostly correct in terms of functionality. However, there are a few issues that need to be addressed for better performance and correctness:\n\n1. **Syntax Error**: The variable `number` is used before it is defined within the loop where `numbers` are iterated through. This results in an error during runtime when attempting to calculate the length of `number`. To fix this, use `num` instead of `number` throughout the function.\n\n2. **Logical Error**: The average calculation at the end only considers permutations once. If more than one permutation is needed for a comprehensive average calculation across all possible shuffles, additional iterations are required to capture these variations in the input list.\n\n3. **Security and Maintainability**: There are no glaring security vulnerabilities or major maintainability issues. The code follows basic Pythonic practices with appropriate use of libraries and functions. However, enhancing performance by processing multiple permutations could be beneficial for larger datasets.\n\n4. **Reliability**: Due to the runtime error caused by an undefined variable (`number`), the function does not work as intended without modification. Additionally, calculating averages across all possible shuffles would benefit from a more robust loop structure or potentially leveraging numpy arrays if performance becomes an issue.",

This means the code will not run correctly for any other input without modification.\n\n2. There are compilation errors due to typos in the variable names: \n   - In the line `sum_diffs += abs(shuffled_perm[i] - shuffled_perm[i + 1])`, it incorrectly refers to `shuffled_perm` as if it were a list, but it's actually an integer due to the previous line where it was set as a single element (0 or 1). This causes a TypeError when trying to access its elements.\n   - Similarly, in the variable name for the number of permutations, `len(numbers)` should be corrected to `len(permutations)`, since `numbers` is not defined outside this scope. \n\n3. The function does not handle edge cases where `numbers` has fewer than two elements correctly. This would lead to a division by zero error when calculating the average, as seen in execution errors.\n\n4.

Overall, while the logic is on the right track, the implementation contains several critical bugs that prevent it from functioning correctly without modification."
