# Instruction
You are an expert source code evaluator. Your task is to analyze a list of the source code generated by AI models
and select the best one.
We will provide you with the user input (the original coding prompt) and a list of 1 AI-generated code response.
You should first read the user input carefully to understand the coding task, and then select the best code 
response based on the **Evaluation** section below.

# Evaluation
## Metric Definition
Each code solution has:
    - an unique number between 0 and 0;
    - a time complexity expressed in Big-O notation;
    - a cognitive complexity. 

You will be assessing each code solution according the following aspects: time complexity and cognitive complexity.
The definition of each criteria is described in Criteria section.
According these criteria, you will generate an integer which is the unique number related to the best code solution. 
Prioritize solutions with lower time complexity first. If time complexities are equal, then prioritize lower cognitive complexity.
The instruction for the coding task is provided in the **User Input** section, while the list of code solutions 
is provided in the **AI-generated Responses** section.


## Criteria
- Time complexity: it measures how the execution time of the algorithm grows as the input size increases. 
Big-O notation is the standard for expressing time complexity. More lower it is (e.g., O(N) is better than O(N^2)), better the code solution is.
- Cognitive complexity: it quantifies the difficulty for a human to understand a piece of code or a function.
More lower it is (e.g., a flat structure is better than deeply nested loops), better the code solution is.

# Output Format
Return only a single integer which corresponds to the unique number of the best code solution choosen.
Your response must be a single integer with **no explanation**, **no text**, and **no punctuation**.
Responding with anything other than a number will be considered an error.


## Evaluation Steps
STEP 1: Analyze each code response in terms of time complexity and cognitive complexity.
STEP 2: Based on the defined criteria and prioritization in **Metric Definition** section, select the best code solution.
STEP 3: Provide your answer as described in **Output Format** section.

Evaluation
EVALUATION PROMPT
# Instruction
You are an expert source code evaluator. Your task is to analyze the quality of the source code generated by AI models.
We will provide you with the user input (the original coding prompt) and an AI-generated code response.
You should first read the user input carefully to understand the coding task, and then evaluate the quality of the code 
response based on the **Evaluation** section below.
You will provide detailed explanations of your findings, including specific counts of compilation and execution errors.

# Evaluation
## Metric Definition
You will be assessing code quality, which is characterized by following aspects: code correctness, security vulnerabilities,
ease of maintenance, reliability, and the presence of compilation and execution errors.
For each criteria, described in Criteria section, you will generate a score between 0 and 100.
The instruction for the coding task is provided in the **User input** section, while the code is provided in the 
**AI-generated Response** section.


## Criteria
Correctness: The code accurately implements the functionality described in the user prompt and produces the expected output.
Security: The code avoids common security vulnerabilities and follows best practices for secure coding.
Maintainability: The code is well-structured, readable, and easy to understand and modify. Consider factors like naming conventions, modularity, comments, and adherence to coding standards.
Reliability: The code handles edge cases and potential errors gracefully, avoiding unexpected crashes or incorrect behavior.
Compilation Errors: The number of syntax errors or other issues that prevent the code from compiling. Provide the count.
Execution Errors: The number of runtime errors or logical errors that cause the code to fail during execution. Provide the count.

# Output Format
You must return your evaluation strictly in the following JSON format:

EXAMPLE OUTPUT:
```

  "Security": 60,
  "Maintainability": 45,
  "Reliability": 20,
  "Compilation Errors": 3,
  "Execution Errors": 0

  ``` def calcola_media(lista):
    somma = 0
    for numero in lista:
        somma += numero
    media = somma / len(numero)
    return media```
    The line len(number) should be len(numbers). Since number is an integer, calling len() on it causes a TypeError at runtime.
    The logic is almost correct, but this bug prevents the function from returning the correct result."
}
```

## Evaluation Steps
STEP 1: Assess the code response in terms of correctness, security, maintainability, and reliability according to the criteria.
        Give for each criteria a score between 0 and 100.
STEP 2: Count the number of compilation errors and execution errors.
STEP 3: Provide your evaluation in the JSON format described in Output Format section.
